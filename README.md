# Quick-Plasma
Problem Statement:Building an instant blood delivery app requires expertise across several technical areas. The core functionality hinges on a robust backend system for managing blood bank inventory, 
tracking blood type compatibility, and ensuring proper cold chain logistics. Security is paramount, demanding strong user authentication, encrypted data storage,and tamper-proof tracking for blood products.
The mobile app itself needs a user-friendly interface for both patients and healthcare providers, with real-time order tracking and clear communication features. Integration with existing hospital 
systems and blood bank databases is crucial for seamless workflow.  Don't forget about robust GPS for efficient delivery routing and temperature monitoring capabilities to guarantee blood quality.

1)In other blood donation apps, there are some problems when people try to register and fail many times or complex UI design. There should be an app for seamless registration and login page  with user-friendly  interface.

2)Blood transfusions often require pre-screening and monitoring by medical professionals. The app would need to integrate with healthcare providers to ensure proper oversight and address any potential complications.

3)Despite efforts to promote donation, some apps may struggle with low user engagement, resulting in a limited pool of available donors.

Female donors health get affected due to their menstrual cycle.

Tech Stacks Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Backend: PHP,GCP,mySQL,botpress

Workflow:
we are first trying to build frontend using html and css. 

From this, user or new people can come to our website and register and login. We provide about us page and article about how giving blood saves so many lives.

For Women, We included period tracker so that women can stay aware during blood donation time.

We will then show the blood stocks.

Then we will create a Chatbot(blood-buddy) to help donor/receiver who has some queries.

We will use GPS tracking system for blood delivery.

then we will build MySQL database to store registered information and updates them one after other.

We are trying to create the frontend code which will be connected with php files in near future.
