tracking blood type compatibility, and ensuring proper cold chain logistics. Security is paramount, demanding strong user authentication, encrypted data storage,and tamper-proof tracking for blood products.
The mobile app itself needs a user-friendly interface for both patients and healthcare providers, with real-time order tracking and clear communication features. Integration with existing hospital 
systems and blood bank databases is crucial for seamless workflow.  Don't forget about robust GPS for efficient delivery routing and temperature monitoring capabilities to guarantee blood quality.
